Usage
=====

Whether you are using the text or web interface the setup is the same. You will need to gather the
chrome histories you want to view into one directory. The filenames of these histories will be
treated as the username that history belongs to. Historian provides two scripts to aid in this
task located in the ``scripts`` directory.
